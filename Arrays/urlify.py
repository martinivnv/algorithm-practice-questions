# Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string
# has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
# length of the string.

# Hints:
# It's often easiest to modify strings by going from the end of the string to the beginning. 
# You might find you need to know the number of spaces. Can you just count them?
